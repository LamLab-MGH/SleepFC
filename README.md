# SleepFC

## Introduction:
This page contains the necessary code to run the analyses from the paper "Sleep network functional connectivity, hyperexcitability, and cognition in Alzheimerâ€™s disease".  
Link: TBD.  

## Files included:  
* "Preprocessing_Features_and_Matrices.ipynb": Preprocess raw EEG timeseries .mat files and .mat sleep staging files to obtain output features and functional connectivity matrices.  
* "Manuscript_Figures.ipynb": Plot the main figures from the paper including FC matrix statistical comparisons, regressions, and box plots.  
* "Cross_sectional_MoCA.ipynb": Cognitive score analysis for the cross-sectional regression.  
* "Longitudinal_decline.R: Longitudinal cognitive score decline analysis.  
* "Preprocess_2nd_night.ipynb": Obtain features and matrices for the 2nd night reproducibility analysis.  
* "ML_group_classification.ipynb": Machine Learning classifier for groups (AD-NoEp, AD-Ep, and HC).  
* "Classifier_MoCA_decline.ipynb": Machine Learning classifier for fast cognitive decline.
